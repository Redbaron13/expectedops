The purpose of this code is to create a database of expected court opinions, relevant information about the cases as is publicly posted on the New Jersey Courts website each day at 10am. 
This code seeks to create a database contianing important case informatiton which can be cross-referenced with decisions that are released the next day at 10am.  

This script uses the html from the site which updates every day at 10am to find and extract the data sought. 

This is still a work in progress and is part of a larger project seeking to make court data and case law more accessible to the general public.
